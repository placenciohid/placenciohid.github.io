        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In the landscape of machine learning, the ability to predict critical events within datasets is not just advantageousâ€”it's transformative. In this project, I delve into the implementation of a sophisticated model that combines a <b>Graph Neural Network-based Imbalanced Node Classification Model (GNN-INCM)</b> with a <b>Hard Sample-based Knowledge Distillation Method (HSKDM)</b>. Tailored for event data classification, this model excels in handling imbalanced class distributions by converting traditional tabular data into a graph structure, thus harnessing the relational nuances inherent in the data.</p>

        <h3>1. Transforming Tabular Data into a Graph Structure</h3>
        <p>The cornerstone of this approach lies in reimagining how data is represented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Feature Extraction</b>: Each record becomes a node in the graph, with its attributes serving as node features. This encapsulates the intrinsic properties of each data point.</li>
            <li><b>Graph Construction</b>: Employing a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm based on feature similarity to build the graph:
                <ul>
                    <li>For every record, identifying the k most similar records.</li>
                    <li>Establishing edges between a record and its k nearest neighbors, constructing the relational framework.</li>
                    <li>Setting the parameter k to 100 to balance computational efficiency and the richness of relational information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This transformation allows the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to data that isn't inherently graph-structured, leveraging the assumption that similar records are likely to share the same class.</p>

        <h3>2. Building the Model Components</h3>
        <p>The model comprises several critical components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>GNNLayer</b>: A flexible layer supporting multiple architectures, including GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and GraphConv, enabling the capture of various relational patterns.</li>
            <li><b>GNNINCM</b>: The core of the model, featuring multiple GNN layers, dropout for regularization, batch normalization for training stability, and fully connected layers for classification.</li>
            <li><b>FocalLoss</b>: A custom loss function designed to address class imbalance by focusing on hard-to-classify samples.</li>
            <li><b>HSKDM Framework</b>: An ensemble approach that enhances model performance through:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ensemble Training</b>: Simultaneously training multiple GNNINCM models to capture diverse perspectives.</li>
                    <li><b>Knowledge Distillation</b>: Aggregating insights from the ensemble to improve generalization.</li>
                    <li><b>Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment</b>: Using validation performance to fine-tune the learning rate.</li>
                    <li><b>Early Stopping</b>: Preventing overfitting by halting training when improvements plateau.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Preparation and Processing</h3>
        <p>Effective model training begins with meticulous data preparation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Balancing</b>: Addressing class imbalance by combining SMOTE (to oversample the minority class) and Random Under-Sampling (to reduce the majority class), resulting in a balanced training dataset.</li>
            <li><b>Feature Scaling</b>: Standardizing features using <code>StandardScaler</code> ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model training process.</li>
            <li><b>Graph Creation</b>: Constructing k-NN graphs for the training, validation, and testing sets embeds the relational structure necessary for GNNs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
        <h3>4. Training the Model</h3>
        <p>The training process is comprehensive and methodical:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Initialization</b>: Setting up multiple instances of GNNINCM with specified hyperparameters.</li>
            <li><b>Optimization</b>: Training with FocalLoss and gradient clipping to handle class imbalance and stabilize training.</li>
            <li><b>Validation</b>: Continuously evaluating model performance on a validation set to guide learning rate adjustments and trigger early stopping.</li>
            <li><b>Checkpointing</b>: Saving the best-performing models based on validation AUC to ensure optimal performance during evaluation.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="col-12">
        <h3>5. Evaluating Model Performance</h3>
        <p>A suite of metrics is employed to thoroughly assess the model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>AUC-ROC</b>: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds.</li>
            <li><b>Recall and Precision</b>: Provide insights into the model's performance on the minority class, which is critical in imbalanced datasets.</li>
            <li><b>F1 Score</b>: Harmonizes precision and recall into a single metric.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Accuracy</b>: Accounts for class imbalance by averaging recall obtained on each class.</li>
            <li><b>Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)</b>: Offers a balanced measure even if classes are of very different sizes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
