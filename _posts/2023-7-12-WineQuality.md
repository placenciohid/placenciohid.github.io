Predicting the quality of wine is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of its physicochemical attributes. In this article, we explore the application of neural networks to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical composition. By leveraging a dataset containing information about various attributes and their impact on wine quality, we aim to develop an accurate and reliable model that can assist wine producers, connoisseurs, and enthusiasts in assessing the quality of red wines.

<h3>Understanding the Dataset</h3>

We begin by thoroughly analyzing a dataset consisting of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset includes attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and the quality rating based on sensory data. We delve into the dataset structure, identify missing or erroneous data, and perform necessary data cleaning steps to ensure reliable analysis.

</h3>Building the Neural Network Model</h3>

To predict the wine quality, we employ a neural network approach. We construct a three-layer neural network model, comprising an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The model takes the physicochemical attributes as input and outputs a prediction of wine quality. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

<h3>Fine-tuning the Model</h3>

Given the dataset's limited size and imbalanced nature, we face challenges in optimizing the model's performance. To address this, we conduct hyperparameter tuning experiments using a grid search approach. By varying the number of epochs and batch sizes, we explore different configurations to identify the optimal combination that maximizes the model's predictive capabilities.

<h3>Evaluating Model Performance</h3>

We evaluate the neural network model using various performance measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve. Additionally, we analyze the confusion matrix to assess the model's ability to correctly classify wines into quality categories. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in predicting wine quality and its overall performance.

<h3>Insights from Feature Importance Analysis</h3>

To gain a deeper understanding of the physicochemical attributes' impact on wine quality prediction, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. The feature importance analysis reveals the contribution of each attribute in the prediction process, shedding light on which factors have the most significant influence on wine quality.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

In conclusion, this article presents a comprehensive analysis of predicting the quality of red wine using a neural network model. By leveraging the dataset's physicochemical attributes, we developed an accurate and reliable model capable of predicting wine quality. The hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics provide valuable insights into optimizing the model's performance and assessing its effectiveness. Moreover, the feature importance analysis using SHAP values offers a deeper understanding of the attributes' contribution to wine quality prediction.

By leveraging this predictive model, wine producers, experts, and enthusiasts can make informed decisions and assessments regarding the quality of red wines based on their chemical composition. This application of neural networks opens up new possibilities for the wine industry, aiding in quality control, vineyard management, and wine selection.
