<!-- Content -->  
Dynamic Zoom is an advanced super-resolution project I had the opportunity to contribute to, focusing on real-time video resolution enhancement. My primary role was implementing the upscaling process using **Bicubic++**, a deep learning model optimized for low latency, and ensuring that the output was displayed in “real-time” alongside the original video. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical computer vision concepts and practical implementation, significantly expanding my knowledge in video processing pipelines.

<h3>Project Overview and Motivation</h3>  

In digital media and real-time applications such as sports analysis, augmented reality, and surveillance, maintaining video quality during zoom operations is essential. Traditional digital zoom methods suffer from quality degradation, resulting in blurred or pixelated images. Dynamic Zoom addresses these challenges by employing **super-resolution** techniques, enhancing visual clarity and preserving detail even during intensive zooming.

<h3>Technical Focus</h3>  

My focus within the project was on optimizing the **Bicubic++** model for real-time applications, minimizing latency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Specifically, I concentrated on:  

- **Reducing Inference Latency**: Achieved inference speeds of approximately **7-8 ms** per frame for 720p to 4K upscaling, ensuring the enhanced video displayed seamlessly without lag.  
- **Integrating Efficient Pipelines**: Structured the video processing pipeline using **PyTorch** and **CUDA**, optimizing memory management and data handling for smoother processing across large video datasets.  
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Developed mechanisms to visualize enhanced frames in parallel with the original video stream, making it possible to view the upscaled content in real time.  

<h3>Pipeline Architecture</h3>  

The system was built around a modular architecture to ensure high performance and scalability:  

1. **InputStream**: Captured video frames, allowing for real-time ROI (Region of Interest) detection and resizing.  
2. **FrameBuffer**: Buffered video frames to ensure smooth and parallel processing.  
3. **ModelExecutor**: Implemented the optimized **Bicubic++** model for rapid upscaling of the frames.  
4. **OutputStream**: Rendered the enhanced frames in sync with the original video stream, providing a side-by-side comparison.  

This pipeline architecture not only reduced latency but also maximized GPU utilization, making it possible to handle high-resolution video streams efficiently.

<h3>Key Results</h3>  

The efforts to optimize the upscaling process yielded impressive results:  

- **High-Quality Output**: The enhanced video maintained sharpness and detail even at high zoom levels.  
- **Minimal Latency**: Achieved real-time processing speeds of 7-8 ms per frame for 720p to 4K upscaling.  
- **Scalable Performance**: The pipeline structure allowed for easy scalability across different hardware configurations.

<h3>Learning Experience and Future Work</h3>  

This project allowed me to apply my computer vision and deep learning knowledge to a real-world problem, gaining hands-on experience with super-resolution techniques and efficient video processing pipelines. The next steps would involve incorporating **temporal-aware models** to handle motion more effectively and **reducing compression artifacts** in lower-quality video inputs.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>  

Dynamic Zoom represents a significant advancement in real-time video processing, providing an effective solution to video quality degradation during digital zoom. My contributions to optimizing the upscaling process helped achieve real-time performance without compromising on quality, making this project a rewarding application of advanced computer vision techniques.
