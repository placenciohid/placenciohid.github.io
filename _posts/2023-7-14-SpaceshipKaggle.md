In the ever-evolving world of data science and machine learning, competitions provide an exciting opportunity to showcase skills and knowledge. Recently, I participated in a Titanic Survival Prediction competition, aiming to develop a robust model that accurately predicts the survival outcome of passengers aboard the ill-fated Spaceship Titanic. This article chronicles my journey and the steps I took to optimize the predictive performance of my submission.

<h4>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h4>

The first crucial step was to gain a deep understanding of the dataset through exploratory data analysis. By meticulously examining the provided features, such as passenger class, age, gender, and ticket fare, I unearthed meaningful insights and potential correlations. This process enabled me to make informed decisions when preprocessing and engineering the data for model training.

<h4>Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</h4>

To ensure the data was in a suitable format for model training, I embarked on a comprehensive data preprocessing journey. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Moreover, I strategically engineered new features, extracting valuable information from the existing ones, to enhance the predictive power of the model.

<h4>Model Selection and Training</h4>

With the preprocessed data in hand, I ventured into selecting the most appropriate machine learning models for the task. I experimented with several popular algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and a Neural Network. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison, I identified the models that exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

<h4>Hyperparameter Tuning</h4>

Realizing that fine-tuning the models could potentially yield further improvements, I delved into hyperparameter tuning. Leveraging techniques like RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, I explored various combinations of hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the Random Forest and XGBoost models. This meticulous process led me to discover the best parameter configurations that significantly boosted the accuracy and robustness of my models.

<h4>Stacking Ensemble</h4>
Inspired by the concept of ensemble learning, I decided to combine the strengths of my top-performing models through a VotingClassifier. By aggregating the predictions of the Random Forest (Tuned) and XGBoost (Tuned) models, I aimed to create a more robust and accurate final prediction. The results were promising, and the ensemble model exhibited excellent accuracy and precision.

<h4>Competition Performance</h4>

My submission secured a position of 1048 out of 2529 participants, which is within the top 42%. This result is a testament to the effectiveness of the techniques I employed and the models I selected. The final model achieved an accuracy of 0.79904, which is a significant improvement over the baseline accuracy of 0.61616. Moreover, the precision and recall scores were 0.79310 and 0.72414, respectively, which are excellent results for a binary classification task.

Through various stages, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble techniques, I steadily improved the predictive performance of my submission. Each step brought me closer to unlocking the full potential of the dataset and honing my understanding of the underlying principles. This experience has been invaluable in broadening my knowledge and refining my skills. I look forward to participating in more competitions and furthering my expertise in the field of data science and machine learning.
