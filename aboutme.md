					<h3>Transforming the Mining Industry with Data Science</h3>
				</header>
				<p>With over 5 years of experience in the mining industry, I've leveraged my skills in data science, machine learning, and project management to drive innovation and optimize operations. As a Data Scientist, I've worked with top mining companies, including Rio Tinto and BHP, to deliver high-impact projects.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>At Rio Tinto, I developed machine learning models to predict blocked orders, applying deep learning model such as Generalized Extre Value Models and Graphical Neural Networks. I also built data pipelines using PySpark Apache and created a comprehensive database of air pollution permits conditions using OCR and large language models.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>As an Agile Delivery Practitioner at BHP, I successfully led projects like "Asset Health - Escondida", delivering significant ROI and improving asset reliability. My expertise in predictive modeling, data pipelines, and agile methodologies enables me to tackle complex challenges and unlock business value.</p>
