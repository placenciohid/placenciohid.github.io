					<h3>Transforming the Mining Industry with Data Science</h3>
				</header>
				<p>With over 5 years of experience in the mining industry, I've leveraged my skills in data science, machine learning, and project management to drive innovation and optimize operations. As a Data Scientist, I've worked with top mining companies, including Rio Tinto and BHP, to deliver high-impact projects.</p>
				<p>At Rio Tinto, I developed machine learning models to predict blocked orders, applying deep learning model such as Generalized Extre Value Models and Graphical Neural Networks. I also built data pipelines using PySpark Apache and created a comprehensive database of air pollution permits conditions using OCR and large language models.</p>
				<p>As an Agile Delivery Practitioner at BHP, I successfully led projects like "Asset Health - Escondida", delivering significant ROI and improving asset reliability. My expertise in predictive modeling, data pipelines, and agile methodologies enables me to tackle complex challenges and unlock business value.</p>

					<h3>Education and Academic Achievements</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I hold a dual Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Civil Engineering and Engineering Sciences from the University of La Serena in Chile, where I developed a strong foundation in engineering principles and problem-solving. My academic experience was further enriched by participating in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Visiting International Student Program, which broadened my global perspective and fostered cultural exchange.</p>
				<p>I have also earned a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I gained expertise in data visualization, data management, and the core concepts of data science. This program provided me with a solid understanding of how to extract insights from data and communicate complex ideas effectively.</p>
				<p>In addition, I hold a Master of Science in Machine Learning and Signal Processing from the same institution, which has given me a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical foundations of machine learning, as well as practical skills in computer vision, deep learning, and neural networks. This program has enabled me to develop and implement advanced machine learning models and algorithms to solve complex problems.</p>
